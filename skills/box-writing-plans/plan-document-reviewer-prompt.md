# Plan Document Self-Review Checklist

Run this checklist on the plan after writing it. Read the plan with fresh eyes before saving.

**Purpose:** Verify the plan is complete, matches the spec, and has proper task decomposition.

## What to Check

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, incomplete tasks, missing steps |
| Spec Alignment | Plan covers spec requirements, no major scope creep |
| Task Decomposition | Tasks have clear boundaries, steps are actionable |
| Buildability | Could an engineer follow this plan without getting stuck? |

## Calibration

**Only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation.**
An implementer building the wrong thing or getting stuck is an issue.
Minor wording, stylistic preferences, and "nice to have" suggestions are not.

Approve unless there are serious gaps — missing requirements from the spec,
contradictory steps, placeholder content, or tasks so vague they can't be acted on.

## Output Format

After reviewing, state:

**Plan Review**

**Status:** Approved | Issues Found

**Issues (if any):**
- [Task X, Step Y]: [specific issue] - [why it matters for implementation]

**Recommendations (advisory, do not block approval):**
- [suggestions for improvement]
